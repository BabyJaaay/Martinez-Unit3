	<h1> Marylin Monroe </h1> 

<div> 
<p> 		Marylin Monroe was born on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. She was a film actress and 	
 		became one of Americas enduring sex symbol. Her mother gained some psychiatirc problems who was soon 
		put into a mental hospital. Monroe never knew her father or met him in her life. Through out her childhood 
		she lived in a foster home and an orphanage. When Marylin turned 11 years old, a family friend and husband
		took her in. Monroe's mother was paying the Goddards family $25 weekly to raise her. The only memory that
		Marylin had of her mother were her trying to smother her at night with a pillow. In 1942, the Goddards		
		family soon had to move to the East Coast having to leave Monroe behind because they couldn't afford it.
		On several occasions Marylin was sexually assualted when she was in the foster homes and her only solution 
		was to get married. At the age of 16 Monroe married a guy Jimmy Dougherty, who was recently her boyffriend on
		June 19, 1942. 
		She dropped out of high school at the age of 15
